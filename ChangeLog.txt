CHANGE LOG FOR LIBDJVU
======================

Changes between 1.96 and 1.95
-----------------------------
o Improved Hanlin V5 support. You don't need to edit libdjvu.c
  to select the model any more, only the Makefile.

o Some optimizations for page rendering on Hanlin V5.

Changes between 1.95 and 1.94
-----------------------------
o Described '5'/Long '5' (save/restore window) functions in
  the Help screen.

o Added support for "3-bit pixel per byte" screen mode.
  (for Hanlin V5 and other needs). To compile libdjvu.so
  for Hanlin V5 (3-bit "pixel per byte") you need to edit libdjvu.c
  and #define EREADER_MODEL HANLIN_V5.

Changes between 1.94 and 1.93
-----------------------------
o BugFix: page of "UNKNOWN" type should be render in COLOUR
  rather than B&W.

o Implemented "save/restore state" function. Pressing Long '7'
  saves the current state and '5' restores it. The state includes
  the page number, zoom factor, zoom factor increment, horizontal
  and vertical shifts, window position, multicolumn mode switch,
  window mark display switch.

Changes between 1.93 and 1.92
-----------------------------
o Returning from "About..." window now uses cached view
  of the page instead of re-generating it. The whole
  content of "About..." is now generated inside libdjvu instead
  of using the API. As a result, we have more space available
  for extra info to put here in the future...

Changes between 1.92 and 1.91
-----------------------------
o Made it possible to have valid DjVu files with *.exe.djvu filenames.

o Added German localization.

o Made debug logging unbuffered.

o Changed the log location to "/home/log/libdjvulog.txt"

o BugFix: Trying to access the page before the first one and then
  go to menu and select "About..." --- returning from "About..." would
  always show the bottom part of the current page instead of the top one.
  Likewise selecting "Goto page..." from the menu and explicitly entering
  the same page number as the current one (after hitting the non-existent
  "page -1") would show the bottom part of the page. All these are fixed now.

o BugFix: In LANDSCAPE mode the window marker was sometimes shown too bold
  (4 pixels wide instead of 1) and sometimes not shown at all.


Changes between 1.91 and 1.9
----------------------------
o Added support for executing programs named ".exe.djvu". This is useful
  for renaming shared libraries in /home/.lib (e.g. to switch between
  different versions of CoolReader libfb2.so)


Changes between 1.9 and 1.8
---------------------------
o Made "force next/prev page" function ('6'/long '6') jump to the
  next/prev column rather than next/prev page in multicolumn mode.


Changes between 1.8 and 1.7
---------------------------
o Implemented Multicolumn mode of moving the window around the page.

o The content of "About..." box localized in English, Russian, Ukrainian and
  Spanish.

o Various small optimizations and cleanups.


Changes between 1.7 and 1.3
---------------------------
o Feature: show the previous window position when panning the window around
  the page vertically. This can be enabled via menu and is helpful for sequential
  reading of the page, i.e. helping the eye locate the next line to read quickly.

o Bugfix: wrong page resolution/version could be shown for pages other than
  the first one.

o Allow larger than 100% values for vertical and horizontal shifts (can be useful
  e.g. for two-column books with narrow columns and large white space in between).

o Help screen (localized in English, Russian, Ukrainian and Spanish).

o Slightly faster initialization and small optimizations in window movements around
  the page.

o Safer error handling of page decoding and other DjVu operations.

o Long presses use the triple rather than double step.
  Reporting of page decoding and rendering times via "About..." box to show the
  significance of using async page readahead feature.

o Change to Makefile --- allow development on x86_64 platform (previously was
  restricted to i386 only).
